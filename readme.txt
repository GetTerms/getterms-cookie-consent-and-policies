The GetTerms plugin allows users to manage their GetTerms compliance packs, embed auto-updating policies, and display their Cookie Consent Widget.

== Description ==

The GetTerms plugin helps you implement cookie consent management and embed legal policies directly into your WordPress site. It connects with your GetTerms account to provide compliant, auto-updating documents and a fully configurable cookie consent banner.

== Features ==

- Connect to your GetTerms Compliance Pack using a unique token.
- Embed the Cookie Consent Widget site-wide or via manual integration.
- Shortcodes to display live-updated legal documents (Privacy Policy, Terms, AUP, etc.).
- Support for multiple languages for both widget and policies.

== Installation ==

1. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Navigate to `Plugins > Add New`.
3. Search for `GetTerms Cookie Consent and Policies`.
4. Click `Install Now` and then `Activate`.

== Usage ==

=== Setting Up ===
1. Navigate to `GetTerms` in the WordPress admin menu.
2. Enter your GetTerms token and save your settings.

=== Embedding the Cookie Consent Widget ===
- Enable the auto-embed option in plugin settings to insert the consent widget in the `&lt;head&gt;` tag.
- You can also embed manually with the provided script tag for advanced use cases or multilingual configurations.
- To ensure proper consent enforcement, embed the script as early as possible in the head section.
- If you have manually included other scripts in your `&lt;head&gt;` the recommendation is to manually embed the GetTerms script above all other scripts, and not use auto-embed

=== Using Shortcodes ===
Use the following shortcodes to display your policy documents:

- `[getterms_privacy_en]`, `[getterms_terms_en]`, `[getterms_aup_en]`
- `[getterms_privacy_fr]`, `[getterms_terms_fr]`, `[getterms_aup_fr]`
- Additional languages and policies are listed in the plugin settings.

== Data Collection and Privacy ==

The plugin communicates with the GetTerms content network (`https://app.getterms.io`, `https://gettermscmp.com`, `https://gettermscdn.com`) to deliver policy content and manage cookie consent. The following data is transmitted:

- **Authentication Token**: Used to authenticate and fetch Compliance Pack data.
- **Domain Name**: Validates the pluginâ€™s authorization and retrieves domain-specific settings.
- **User Consent Logs**: Records of accepted/rejected cookie categories (anonymized).
- **Policy Requests**: Dynamic retrieval of policy content for embedding.
- **Error Logs**: Technical error messages (non-personal) may be sent to assist with debugging.

All data is anonymized where applicable and stored in compliance with GDPR data sovereignty standards.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the GetTerms service to provide cookie consent management and legal policy document hosting. It's needed to display the cookie consent banner, manage user consent preferences, and embed automatically updating legal documents on your website.

The plugin sends the following data to GetTerms (`https://app.getterms.io`, `https://gettermscmp.com`, `https://gettermscdn.com`):
- Authentication token when configuring the plugin to verify your account
- Domain name during setup to validate authorization and retrieve settings
- User consent choices when visitors interact with the cookie banner (anonymized)
- Policy document requests when shortcodes are displayed on pages
- Technical error information for debugging purposes (non-personal data)

This service is provided by GetTerms: [Terms of Service](https://getterms.io/our-terms-of-service), [Privacy Policy](https://getterms.io/our-privacy-policy).
